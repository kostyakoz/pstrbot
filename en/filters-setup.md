## Configuring filters
Using filters you can configure how the bot will send the record.

1. The filters for each page (source) is configured separately. Go to **Sources**, then click on the name of the desired page and choose **“Configure filters”**.
2. Then click on the name of the filters to adjust them. A description of each filter are available in [relevant section of the menu](/help/filters).

### Possible problems
* **“To use this filter, you need to upgrade to Premium.”** Some filters are only available for [Premium](/premium) users.
* **I set up a filter, but it does not work.** It may be necessary to wait until the waiting time that is displayed by the command `/start`.
