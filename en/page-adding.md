## Adding sources
The source is from where the bot will send the record. Currently supported sources from such social services like Instagram, Twitter, VK, RSS feeds.

1. Go to [@pstrbot](//telegram.me/pstrbot), select **“Add source”**. If this section is not on the menu, so you haven't [added channel](/help/channel-adding).
2. Using the menu below select the channel to which you want to connect the source (page).
3. Next, you need to choose the source type.
4. Following the instructions of the bot, send the complete address of your desired page.
5. After adding pages, you can configure it in the page **Sources**.

### Possible problems
* **You have already added the maximum number of sources**. For free users this limit is 10 sources and for the [Premium](/premium) — 25. To add another page, you need to remove the old one or buy a Premium subscription.
* **Invalid address page.** This means that the bot cannot access the page you specify. Try to check the address and send it to the bot again.
