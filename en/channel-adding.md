## Adding channels
To add the bot to your channel (whether private or public), you need to make **@pstrbot** the administrator of the channel. If the channel has no messages, then you need to write any.

1. Go to [@pstrbot](//telegram.me/pstrbot), select **“My channels”**, then **“Add channel”**.
2. Following the instructions of the bot, send any message from the channel in the chat [@pstrbot](//telegram.me/pstrbot).
3. If all goes well, the channel should appear in the list of attached channels.

### Possible problems
* **Bot is not an administrator of the channel.** To fix this, open the list of administrators desired channel and **search** add a bot [@pstrbot](//telegram.me/pstrbot).
